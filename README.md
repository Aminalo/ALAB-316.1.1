# JavaScript Event Handling Lab – Dropdown Menu

##  Project Overview
This project is part of a JavaScript lab focused on **DOM manipulation** and **event handling**.  
The goal was to create a simple navigation bar with a **submenu** that appears when the user interacts with the main menu item.  

By completing this lab, I practiced:
- Selecting elements with JavaScript  
- Attaching event listeners (`mouseover`, `mouseout`, `click`)  
- Dynamically toggling CSS styles with JavaScript  
- Debugging DOM interaction issues

## Features
- A **main menu** with submenu support  
- Submenu appears when hovering or clicking on the menu item  
- Event handling with `addEventListener()`  
- Clean and simple JavaScript implementation

## File Structure
project-folder/
│── index.html # Main HTML file
│── style.css # Styling for menu and submenu
│── script.js # JavaScript event handling logic
│── README.md # Documentation (this file)

---

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the project files  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. Hover over or click the menu item to see the submenu appear

## Lessons Learned
- DOM elements can be accessed using `document.querySelector` or `getElementById`.  
- Event listeners allow interactive behavior without reloading the page.  
- Debugging is essential: small typos in CSS selectors or event names can break functionality.  
- There are **multiple valid solutions** in JavaScript – what matters most is that the functionality works.

##  Completion
If the menu works as expected (submenu appears when triggered), then the lab is successfully completed.
